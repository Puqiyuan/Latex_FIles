function. \textcolor{black}{Last but not least}, the screen will shut down unexpectedly and

\subsection{The First Paragraph}
\label{sec:first-paragraph}

In this paragraph, we focus on image description. 

\subsubsection{Example}
\label{sec:example-3}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{black}{As is shown above, } \textcolor{black}{in the sea floats a
    fishing-boat, } \textcolor{black}{catching fishes, } \textcolor{black}{with a number
    of sea creatures swimming in the ocean }, on the contrary in 1995, there was only one
  fish, \textcolor{black}{with many fishing-boats crowding in the sea}.
  
\item \textcolor{black}{As is shown in the cartoon, } \textcolor{black}{in the darkness
    happily stands a candle, } \textcolor{black}{spreading brightness around itself.}

\item \textcolor{black}{As is vividly shown in the photo, } \textcolor{black}{in the
    sunshine stands a pretty American girl, (who is) in Chinese traditional clothes, }
  \textcolor{black}{wearing necklace and its like,} \textcolor{black}{with a sweet smile
    on her face.}

\item \textcolor{black}{As is shown above, } \textcolor{black}{In the black house stands a
    delicate flower, }  \textcolor{black}{growing vigorously, } \textcolor{black}{with the
    shelter protecting it from the brush of the storm. } When remove out of the
  protection, \textcolor{black}{the flower cannot stand and quickly dies, }
  \textcolor{black}{with it's leaves falling in the wind.}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pattern}
\label{sec:pattern}
\par \textcolor{black}{As is shown above, } \textcolor{black}{In the...stands/floats/..., }
\textcolor{black}{growing/wearing..., } \textcolor{black}{with...}

\subsubsection{Common Beginning Sentence Pattern}
\label{sec:comm-beginn-sent-2}

\begin{itemize}
\item As is shown in the picture above...
\item The pictures above vividly describe + noun.
\item The drawing above does demonstrate a certain thought-provoking social phenomnon.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Common Ending Sentence Pattern}
\label{sec:comm-ending-sent-3}

\begin{itemize}
\item Certain informative implication is revealed in the picture above.
\item The implication is not only informative, but instructive as well.
\item The picture, at the first glimpse, seems to be simple, but only a penetrating sight
  can pierce through its superficial meaning.
\item This issue is becoming a matter of concern for more and more people, especially for...
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Second Paragraph}
\label{sec:second-paragraph}
In this paragraph, we put forward argument and prove it.

\subsubsection{Pattern}
\label{sec:pattern-1}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Put Forward Argument:
  \par \textcolor{black}{The picture demonstrate a common fact that }the new technology has
  changed our ordinary way of life, but many smart devices have adversely affected our
  interpersonal relationship --- we are too dependent on the new digital devices to maintain
  normal communication between people.
  
\item Emphasize Argument:
  \par \textcolor{black}{In other words, }we ignore the importance of communication,
  \textcolor{black}{especially }the face-to-face one, suggesting possibility of threatening the
  normal relationship among us.

\item Prove Argument:
  \par According to a survey conducted by the related research institute recently, the
  hours spent on the using of phones per-person each day have reached as much as 5.4
  hours, which means these new devices the lives of a modern soul from day to night.

\item Example:
  \par As is reported, an old father even overturns the dining table when his children pay
  a visit to him, annoyed by his children who are indulging in their mobile phones and
  ignoring the communication with father and mother, even when their old mother has
  elaborated a great meal for them.

\item Summary:
  \par \textcolor{black}{The symptoms of this kind of phenomenon are not difficult to find}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Third Paragraph}
\label{sec:third-paragraph}

In this paragraph, we pose the solutions.

\subsubsection{Common Mode}
\label{sec:common-mode}

\hspace{0.4cm} \textcolor{black}{The general public is supposed to enhance their awareness that} ocean resources are
essential for the environment. \textcolor{black}{In this issue, researchers, scholars and experts are
expected to work out up-to-date solutions to} \emph{something}. \textcolor{black}{In view of
the complexity of such an issue, we must treat it socially, economically and
culturally. In a sense, it is not why } \emph {something} exists in today's what we should
do to cope with it.

\begin{center}
  \section{ESSAY RECITE}
\label{sec:essay}
\end{center}

\subsection{Negative/Environmental/}
\label{sec:negative}

\hspace{0.5cm}\textcolor{black}{As is shown above}, \textcolor{black}{on the lake }floats a
boat, \textcolor{black}{on which one }couple of tourist are throwing waste into the lake,
\textcolor{black}{which} has been in mess and full of various wastes including lunch boxes,
fish bones and its like. \textcolor{black}{The primary purpose of the pictures above is that
due attention should paid to the urgent problem that }people's inappropriate behaviors
lead to the severe destruction of environment.

\par \textcolor{black}{The picture is telling us that} the environmental \textcolor{black}{problem is 
not only harmful but also detrimental}. \textcolor{black}{Behind the scene presented above,
there lurks a host of problem of some higher level}. Smog, acid rain, global warming, and
the thinness of ozone layers possibly change of wild species. Industrial sewage dumped
into rivers or lakes pollutes water; this may cause the death of fishes and other aquatic
species. People living by the river will probably develop strange diseases. Were there no
environmental protection, never would we taste the real happiness of life.

\par \textcolor{black}{To solve this burning problem, it is imperative for people to
  combines efforts to raise safety standards of} all industrial facilities,
\textcolor{black}{to set up} international cooperated laboratory, \textcolor{black}{to}
monitor the state of environment and set up an international center for emergency
environment assistance. \textcolor{black}{All these measures will help us in solving these
  important problems and} prevent us from dangerous illnesses and
disease. \textcolor{black}{We'd better bear the following sentence in mind} ``Don't blow it
--- good planets are hard to find.``

\subsection{Positive/Teamwork}
\label{sec:positive}

\hspace{0.5cm} \textcolor{black}{As is vividly depicted in the picture,} two disabled men
are running fast through teamwork although each of them has only one
leg. \textcolor{black}{Obviously}, \textcolor{black}{it is }teamwork \textcolor{black}{that
  makes it possible }for them to go anywhere they want to.

\par \textcolor{black}{Simple as it is , what the picture conveys to us is
  though-provoking. } \textcolor{black}{With the development of economy and society,
}competition is becoming increasingly fierce. \textcolor{black}{It is impossible for anyone
  to }finish work all by himself. \textcolor{black}{Hence, people in mounting numbers put great
  emphasis on }teamwork. \textcolor{black}{In fact, it has been universally acknowledged that
  the ability of }teamwork \textcolor{black}{is the most essential qualification that anyone
  who wants to achieve success should posses}.

\par \textcolor{black}{According, it is imperative for us to take some measures to enhance
  the sense of}teamwork \textcolor{black}{in our society}. \textcolor{black}{We should hear in mind that
}teamwork \textcolor{black}{is of great of significance to both our society and ourselves.}
\textcolor{black}{Every one should have the ability of }teamwork. \textcolor{black}{Only in this
  way can we }achieve success and \textcolor{black}{only in this can our} society become harmonious to live in.

\subsection{Other Essay}
\label{sec:other-essay}

\subsubsection{Optimistic/Pessimism/Choose/Attitude}
\label{sec:optimistic}

\hspace{0.4cm} \textcolor{black}{As is shown above ,in the middle of the picture} stand two persons,
looking at the dropped/broken wine/milk bottle, showing different reactions,one sighting
that“there is nothing left”, and the other being grateful that “there is something
left”. \textcolor{black}{Simple as the picture is, a certain informative information is
  revealed in it}. 

\par {The picture demonstrates two strikingly different attitudes}, pessimism and
optimism, \textcolor{black}{when} facing the same thing and tells us that the enthusiasm and
the optimism are of paramount importance when it comes to the personal growth,
\textcolor{black}{especially in this ever rapid changing modern society}. \textcolor{black}{Due
  attention to this quality is attached by individuals and even the whole society}. Those
with optimistic attitude to the life can relieve not only pressure, \textcolor{black}{but
  also} anxiety and such problems as depression and solitude. Favorable attitude to the
life can broaden our mind, enrich our experience and enhance our vigor then create an
enthusiastic environment for our society. People with the spirit of optimism
\textcolor{black}{can not only} accumulate wealth, \textcolor{black}{but will also} establish
their career, fit into society, \textcolor{black}{and even} attain social
status. \textcolor{black}{Were there no} positive mental attitude, \textcolor{black}{never
  would we} taste the real happiness of the success.

\par \textcolor{black}{To sum up}, one’s view and attitude on his life determines his
future. Different life attitude may bring about entirely different results. Many
psychologically fragile and pessimistic young people around us too easily become
discouraged and give up when confronting with difficulties , which makes it hard to
believe those youngsters with such mind state can face the challenge and become pillars of
the society.

\subsubsection{Family/Affection/Tradition}
\label{sec:familyaffection}

\hspace{0.4cm} \textcolor{black}{As is shown above}, three decades ago,\textcolor{black}{in the
  first picture} walked a mother and a daughter, \textcolor{black}{with} the young mother
holding her loving her lovely daughter's ting hand. \textcolor{black}{By contrast, in the
  other picture}, now ,the little girl has grown up and support her aged mom by taking her
arm, \textcolor{black}{with} the gratifying smile on the mother's face. \textcolor{black}{The
  scene is described by the caption}:mutual accompanying and supporting.

\par \textcolor{black}{It is unsurprising that readers may get a} warm sensation or feel
touched, because the dependable support and unfailing love of family as illustrated by the
pictures are endearing and invaluable to every one of us. \textcolor{black}{At the same
  time, there is no doubt that these pictures remind us that the} filial piety,
\textcolor{black}{an invaluable Chinese tradition and powerful cohesive force that us
  together,is the steel that forges the supporting structure of our society,It this
  invaluable asset is ever neglected in any possible manner. Our society will not be able
  to grow steadily, although some traditions have become the dead symbols or abstract
  concepts to be found in dusted books.}

\par \textcolor{black}{To make our society a better place, positive examples of this kind
  shall be made known and fallowed by people in every profession and in every corner. Our
ardent love for life will further guarantee the prosperity of this life-affirming
force. It is no exaggeration to claim that the world will become a big loving family if
good-willing deeds like thia become a common practice that happens daily.}

\subsubsection{Learning/Enterprising/Young/Mentality}
\label{sec:learningenterprising}

\hspace{0.4cm} \textcolor{black}{In the illuminating picture}, \textcolor{black}{on the}
stairs runs an old man, \textcolor{black}{seeming} energetic and vigorous,
\textcolor{black}{with} a young man, \textcolor{black}{dripping} sweat, \textcolor{black}{being}
fatigued after climbing some stairs. \textcolor{black}{Simple as the picture is, the meaning
  behind it is virtually thought-provoking. Just as Franklin Roosevelt once said, man is
  not old as long as he is seeking something}.

\par \textcolor{black}{The picture indicates that} youth is not a time of life but a state
of mind. A person who is enthusiastic about his life can perpetually retain supreme
power. \textcolor{black}{A typical example} is Ji Xianlin, a famous scholar in China. He
dedicated his whole life to the study of liberal arts and even in this later years, he was
still open-minded about new findings and contributed many sagacious
ideas. \textcolor{black}{In contrast}, if a person has no passion about life, he, even at a
young age, may appear lifeless. Without pursuit, people are likely to surrender to
obstacles in their lives. \textcolor{black}{For example, many psychologically fragile young
  people around us too easily become discouraged and give up when confronted with
  difficulties.It is hard to believe those young people with old minds can meet challenges
  and become pillars of the society}.

\par \textcolor{black}{As argued above, the two distinct life attitudes bring about entirely
  different results. Therefore, all of us}, both young and old, should keep our enthusiasm
to live meaningfully.


\subsubsection{Food/Society/Safety}
\label{sec:foodsocietysafety}

\hspace{0.4cm} \textcolor{black}{As is vividly depicted in the picture, on the playground}
run two relay race athletes, \textcolor{black}{with} a famous chemical component,
\textcolor{black}{which is well-known due to} the milk powder scandal,
\textcolor{black}{being} handed from the one, a cow to the other, an
egg. \textcolor{black}{There has been a heated discussion on the newspaper about this
  picture. The author's real purpose is not the fact itself, but to lead us to find what
  hides behind the iceberg}.

\par \textcolor{black}{The artist who creates this picture intends to draw our attention to
  the serious social issue of} food safety which has sparked nationwide discussions after
such well-publicized scandals as the poisonous milk powder. And this discussion has been
further fueled by the contaminated eggs. Some famous milk powder manufacturers of our
country put melamine in their milk products, causing the damage of organs even the death
of hundblacks of children around the nation. So, it's OK(understandable) that people are
alert when hearing about the melamine contamination of the eggs.

\par The milk powder scandal, \textcolor{black}{however, is only the tip of an iceberg with
  regard to poor quality food in the whole} food manufacturing
industry. \textcolor{black}{In order to reverse the situation and restore people's
  confidence and rust in the government, it is imperative that legislative
  measures(should)be taken to severely punish those} who dare to venture consumers' health
for their profits. \textcolor{black}{In addition, strict food quality inspection protocols
  should be established to prevent sub-standards} food products from reaching the
customers. \textcolor{black}{In this way, hopefully, we may start} eating manufactublack food
without health damaging effects afterwards.
